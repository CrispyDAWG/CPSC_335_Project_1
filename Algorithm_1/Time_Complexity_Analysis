Revised Time Complexity Analysis:
1. Initialization of positions array: O(n)
   - This step creates a lookup table for constant-time access to each person's position.

2. Main loop: O(n)
   - The loop runs n/2 times (once for each couple).
   - Each iteration performs constant time operations:
     a. Identifying the correct partner: O(1)
     b. Checking if a swap is needed: O(1)
     c. Performing the swap if necessary: O(1)
     d. Updating positions: O(1)

3. The key efficiency comes from:
   a. Constant-time lookups using the positions array.
   b. Each swap correctly positions two elements.
   c. Elements already in correct positions are not moved.

4. Worst-case scenario:
   - Even in the worst case, each element is moved at most once.
   - This means the total number of swaps is at most n/2.

Overall Time Complexity: O(n)
- The algorithm maintains linear time complexity even in the worst case.
- It's efficient as each swap optimally positions two elements.

Space Complexity: O(n) 
- The positions array uses O(1) extra space (max size of 30).
- This allows for O(1) lookups, crucial for the algorithm's efficiency.
- The issue is row size can vary leading to a space complexity of O(n).

Optimality:
- This algorithm achieves the minimum possible number of swaps.
- It's optimal in both time and result, as it directly moves each element to its final position in at most one swap.

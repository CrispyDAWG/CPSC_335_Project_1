time complexity analysis: 

1. initialization:
  n = 5	// 5 cities, takes O(1) time to assign the length of list
  tank = 0	// current fuel in tank, O(1)
  total_fuel_surplus = 0	// total fuel surplus, O(1)
  start_city = 0	// starting city index, O(1)

2. first loop to calculate the fuel surplus:
  // need to make sure the fuel gained at each city is enough to travel to the next city

  City 0:
    Fuel gained = fuel[0] * mpg = 1 * 10 = 10
    Fuel needed = city_distances[0] = 5
    Fuel surplus = 10 - 5 = 5
    Update total_fuel_surplus = 0 + 5 = 5
  City 1:
    Fuel gained = fuel[1] * mpg = 2 * 10 = 20
    Fuel needed = city_distances[1] = 25
    Fuel surplus = 20 - 25 = -5
    Update total_fuel_surplus = 5 - 5 = 0
  City 2:
    Fuel gained = fuel[2] * mpg = 1 * 10 = 10
    Fuel needed = city_distances[2] = 15
    Fuel surplus = 10 - 15 = -5
    Update total_fuel_surplus = 0 - 5 = -5
  City 3:
    Fuel gained = fuel[3] * mpg = 0 * 10 = 0
    Fuel needed = city_distances[3] = 10
    Fuel surplus = 0 - 10 = -10
    Update total_fuel_surplus = -5 - 10 = -15
  City 4:
    Fuel gained = fuel[4] * mpg = 3 * 10 = 30
    Fuel needed = city_distances[4] = 15
    Fuel surplus = 30 - 15 = 15
    Update total_fuel_surplus = -15 + 15 = 0

  total fuel surplus = 5 - 5 - 5 - 10 + 15 = 0
  Since the total fuel surplus is not negative, it means the trip is feasible, so the program will continue and not return -1.

3. Conditional check for total fuel surplus: O(1)

4. Second loop to find the preferred starting point:
  // need to find the best starting city, and make sure the fuel in the tank is enough to travel to the next city starting from each city.
  
  City 0:
    Fuel gained = fuel[0] * mpg = 10
    Fuel needed = city_distances[0] = 5
    Tank status = tank = 0 + 10 - 5 = 5 > 0 => no need to adjust the city and reset the tank
    
  City 1:
    Fuel gained = fuel[1] * mpg = 20
    Fuel needed = city_distances[1] = 25
    Tank status = tank = 5 + 20 - 25 = 0 => no need to adjust the city and reset the tank
    
  City 2:
    Fuel gained = fuel[2] * mpg = 10
    Fuel needed = city_distances[2] = 15
    Tank status = tank = 0 + 10 - 15 = -5 < 0 => start_city = 2 + 1 = 3 and reset tank = 0.

  City 3:
    Fuel gained = fuel[3] * mpg = 0
    Fuel needed = city_distances[3] = 10
    Tank status = tank = 0 + 0 - 10 = -10 < 0 => start_city = 3 + 1 = 4 and reset tank = 0.

  City 4:
    Fuel gained = fuel[4] * mpg = 30
    Fuel needed = city_distances[4] = 15
    Tank status = tank = 0 + 30 - 15 = 15 > 0 => no need to adjust the city and reset the tank

  Initially, tank = 0, start_city = 0. Calculate the fuel level in the tank after traveling from each city. After calculation, we found the city 4 is the best choice that can allow the vehicle to complete the journey without running out of fuel.
  The loop runs n times, same operation as the first loop, so the calculation takes O(1) time.
  The conditional check is evaluated n times, each taking O(1) time. Updates the starting index and reset tank, both of them take O(1) time.
  So, the loop takes O(n) + O(1) = O(n) time.

5. Worst-case scenario:
  Fuel is not enough at the beginning: In cities near the start of the list, fuel may be insufficient to complete the trip, forcing the algorithm to shift the starting city multiple times.
  Best starting city is at the end of the list: This means we need to iterate all cities a couple times, reset the tank and adjust the city, then we find the best starting city.

6. Space time complexity( O(1) ):
  The input variables take O(n) space, but since they are part of the input and not extra storage, they don't count towards the additional space complexity of the algorithm.
  Two loops modify and use the existing variables, it takes O(1) space.
7. Total time complexity:
  O(1) + O(n) + O(1) + O(n) = O(n)
